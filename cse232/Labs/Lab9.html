    <h1>Templates</h1>
    <p>Templates are a way to make your code more flexible and reusable. They allow you to write code that can be used with different data types without having to rewrite the code for each data type. In this lab, you will learn how to use templates in C++.</p>
    <!-- Code in templates/main.cpp matrix.hpp-->
    <h2>Matrix Template</h2>
    <p>In this lab, you will implement a template for a matrix class. The matrix class should be able to store elements of any data type. The matrix class should have the following methods:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Constructor: The constructor should take the number of rows and columns as arguments and initialize the matrix with the given number of rows and columns.</li>
        <li>Get: The get method should take the row and column index as arguments and return the element at the given row and column index.</li>
        <li>Set: The set method should take the row and column index and the value as arguments and set the element at the given row and column index to the given value.</li>
        <li>Print: The print method should print the matrix to the console.</li>
    </ul>
