üç´: <span style="color:green">When the The waves travel there will be the inertia to the wave and also and there will be increase in distance from the moment wave left the planet?</span>

Yes, from the perspective of physics, this point is completly valid. Generally, The time take for round trip wave travel is given by $\frac{2*\textit{distance}}{c}$, but if there is a relative velocity, i.e one planet is moving with respect to other, then we need to account for 2 things planet movement adds intertia so velocity of wave will be ( c + v ), as light can be treated as both particle and wave. and the return distance will not be d but ( d + vt ). 
$$
\textit{time} = \frac{2*\textit{distance}}{c}
$$
$$
\textit{time} = \frac{2*\textit{distance}}{c - 2v}
$$
As $v <<<< c$, and we only need time in 2 decimal precision, 2v can be ignored.
