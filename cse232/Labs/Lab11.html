    <p>Algorithms are a fundamental part of computer science. They are step-by-step procedures for solving problems and are essential for writing efficient code. In this lab, you will learn how to implement algorithms in C++.</p>
    <h2>In this lab we will use sort, partition, accumulate, and iota algorithms</h2>
