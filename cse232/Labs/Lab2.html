Problem given a integer you need to return the sum of digits recuresively.
Suppose 999 -> 27 -> 9

We will build from scratch, maximum integer is 9...(9) count. So we can always get the single number in maximum of 3 steps, we will try with dirty code and start cleaning and make it reusable and modular.



General trick to count digits is implememented using while loop, but there is a for loop implementation
```cpp
for (n; n != 0; n = n/10){
    r = n % 10;
    sum = sum + r;
}
