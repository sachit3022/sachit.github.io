    <p>When the The waves travel there will be the inertia to the wave and also and there will be increase in distance from the moment wave left the planet?</p>

    <p>Yes, from the perspective of physics, this point is completely valid. Generally, The time take for round trip wave travel is given by $\frac{2*\textit{distance}}{c}$, but if there is a relative velocity, i.e one planet is moving with respect to other, then we need to account for 2 things planet movement adds inertia so velocity of wave will be ( c + v ), as light can be treated as both particle and wave. and the return distance will not be d but ( d + vt ).</p>

    <p>$$\textit{time} = \frac{2*\textit{distance}}{c}$$</p>
    <p>$$\textit{time} = \frac{2*\textit{distance}}{c - 2v}$$</p>
    <p>As $v &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; c$, and we only need time in 2 decimal precision, 2v can be ignored.</p>
