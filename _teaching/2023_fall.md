This course is taught by [Dr Josh Nahum](http://www.nahum.us/). Information related to the [cse 232 course](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse232/). All the credit is directed towards [Dr Josh Nahum](http://www.nahum.us/). This page provides commentary and supplementary details of the Lab section of the course. This page also gives credit to amazing students who ask  <span style="color:green"> good questions that deserve mention </span> 🍫🍫🍫.


# LAB 0
The goal of the lab is to introduce [pair programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html). The story of famous google [pair programmers](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge) Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat. These labs provides you safe space to think and give you hands on experience, which will help you with the exams and home works.
# LAB 1
I/O operations, Type casting of C++, How to think programatically.

🍫🍫🍫: <span style="color:green">When the The waves travel there will be the inertia to the wave and also and there will be increase in distance from the moment wave left the planet?</span>

Yes, from the perspective of physics, this point is completly valid. Generally, The time take for round trip wave travel is given by $\frac{2*\textit{distance}}{c}$, but if there is a relative velocity, i.e one planet is moving with respect to other, then we need to account for 2 things planet movement adds intertia so velocity of wave will be ( c + v ), as light can be treated as both particle and wave. and the return distance will not be d but ( d + vt ). 
$$
\textit{time} = \frac{2*\textit{distance}}{c}
$$
$$
\textit{time} = \frac{2*\textit{distance}}{c - 2v}
$$
As $v <<<< c$, and we only need time in 2 decimal precision, 2v can be ignored.
# LAB 2
Introduction to functions, loops, Intro to recursion and time complexity.

🍫🍫🍫: <span style="color:green">for loop implementation of counting digit</span>

General trick to count digits is implememented using while loop, but there is a for loop implementation
```cpp
for (n; n != 0; n = n/10){
    r = n % 10;
    sum = sum + r;
}
```
