Hello! I am a Second-year Masters Student in the [Computer Science and Engineering Department](http://www.cse.msu.edu) at [Michigan State University](http://www.msu.edu/) pursuing my masters degree under the supervision of [Dr. Vishnu Boddeti](http://vishnu.boddeti.net/). I am extremely lucky to have amazing colleagues at [Human Analysis Lab](https://hal.cse.msu.edu/). In my past life I have received my bachelor's degree from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India](https://www.iitg.ac.in/). 

My research goal, broadly speaking, is to understand and improve generalization in machine learning. One perspective on my work is that a generalized model will perform better across all the below tasks.

- Distribution shift
    - [Addressing Distribution Shift in classical Machine Leaning](https://sachit3022.github.io/files/Pattern_Recognition.pdf)
- Algorithmic Fairness
    - [Notes on Constrained Optimization and Min-Max Problems](https://sachit3022.github.io/files/Optimisation.pdf)
    - [Improving fairness in LLMs](https://sachit3022.github.io/files/Fairness_LLM.pdf)
- Adversarial Machine Learning
   - [Survey: All Things Adversarial in LLMs](https://sachit3022.github.io/blog/)
- Privacy
    - [Machine Unlearning](https://sachit3022.github.io/files/Unlearning.pdf)



I also care about the impact of ML and have worked on some practical problems such as multi-modal representations and data parallelization.

 - [Parallel GPT](https://github.com/sachit3022/pGPT/blob/master/Report.pdf)





I teach programming ([CSE 232](https://sachit3022.github.io/teaching/2023-fall)) at Michigan State university. 

I enjoy [running](https://sachit3022.github.io/other-blog/posts/running/ ) on a rare sunny day in East Lansing, MI. On a gloomy day, I sitdown with a sip of coffee â˜• and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/sachit3022/).
