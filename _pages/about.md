Hello! I am a Second-year Masters Student in the [CSE Department](http://www.cse.msu.edu) at [Michigan State University](http://www.msu.edu/) pursuing my master's degree under the supervision of [Dr. Vishnu Boddeti](http://vishnu.boddeti.net/). I am extremely lucky to have amazing colleagues at [Human Analysis Lab](https://hal.cse.msu.edu/). I received my bachelor's degree from [IIT, Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/). 

My research goal is to improve the capacity of machine learning systems to generalize effectively. 
This includes working on areas like spurious correlation, algorithmic fairness, adversarial machine learning, and privacy preservation. By solving these problems, I aim to enhance the robustness and reliability of AI systems. 

- <b>Spurious Correlation:</b> The general model must pay attention to the important parts of the image (like the wolf's features) rather than getting distracted by irrelevant details (like the snowy background).
    - [Addressing Spurious Correlation in Classical Machine Learning](https://sachit3022.github.io/files/Pattern_Recognition.pdf)
- <b>Algorithmic Fairness: </b> The general model shouldn't base its decisions on sensitive attributes like gender. It ensures fair decisions for everyone.
    - [Notes on Constrained Optimization and Min-Max Problems](https://sachit3022.github.io/files/Optimisation.pdf)
    - [Improving Fairness in LLMs](https://sachit3022.github.io/files/Fairness_LLM.pdf)
- <b>Adversarial Machine Learning:</b> A useful model should be helpful and harmless.
   - [Survey: All Things Adversarial in LLMs](https://sachit3022.github.io/blog/)
- <b> Privacy: </b> The general model should not memorize the training data.
    - [Machine Unlearning](https://sachit3022.github.io/files/Unlearning.pdf)

I also care about the impact of ML and have worked on some practical problems such as multi-modal representations and data parallelization. 

- [Prediction algorithms for large-scale multi-modal with imbalance.](https://sachit3022.github.io/blog/)
 - [Parallel GPT](https://github.com/sachit3022/pGPT/blob/master/Report.pdf)

I teach programming ([CSE 232](https://sachit3022.github.io/teaching/2023-fall)) at Michigan State University. 

I enjoy [running](https://sachit3022.github.io/other-blog/posts/running/ ) on a rare sunny day in East Lansing, MI. On a gloomy day, I sit down with a sip of coffee â˜• and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/sachit3022/).  


 <span style="color:red;"><strong> Open to internship for Summer/Fall 2024. I am also on the job market starting December 2024. Please reach out to me.</strong></span>
